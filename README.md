### git concepts for human beings

This is currently material for a talk on git concepts with some supporting code. There is more to come!

## yet another git talk?

This talk is different. The intended audience is for people who use git but still don't necessarily "get git" yet.

This talk explains git using basic Computer Science concepts in multiple ways. 
My hope is that presenting the same information visually, textually, and in code will provide audiences with a
combination of formats that really reinforces the concepts of git.

The content is not necessarily a fully technically correct discription of git internals, but is more of an
exploration of the concepts using familiar programming fundamentals.
