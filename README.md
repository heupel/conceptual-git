# Conceptual Git

This is a talk on Git concepts with some supporting code.

## Yet Another Git Talk?

This talk is different.  The intended audience is for developers who use Git but still don't necessarily "get git" yet.

This talk explains Git using basic Computer Science concepts in multiple ways.
My hope is that presenting the same information visually, textually, and in code will provide
audiences with a combination that really reinforces the concepts in Git.

This is not necessarily a fully technically correct discription of Git internals, but more an exploration of
the concepts using familiar programming concepts.
