The intended audience is for developers who use Git but still don't necessarily \"get git\" yet.\r\n\r\nThis talk explains Git using basic Computer Science concepts in multiple ways.\r\nMy hope is that presenting the same information visually, textually, and in code will provide\r\naudiences with a combination that really reinforces the concepts in Git.\r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a fully technically correct discription of Git internals, but more an exploration of\r\nthe concepts using familiar programming concepts.\r\n\r\n# Licensing\r\n\r\nWhile I am providing all of this out in the open, I do NOT intend for others to modify for their own uses or to\r\ncreate derivative works of their own.
